// Introduction to MERN Stack
// MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. 

// MongoDB - It is a document database, which aligns and works perfectly with javascript.
// Express(.js) - It is a backend web application framework for Node.js.
// React(.js) - A client-side Javascript framework
// Node(.js) - The premier Javascript web server
// Note: We will maintain the backend and the React app separately. Remember, the node module of the express application and the react app will not be the same.
