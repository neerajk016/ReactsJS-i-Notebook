// Create React App - iNotebook
// To create a react app, firstly open Windows PowerShell and execute the create react app command:npx create-react-app iNotebook
// iNotebook information: This is the name of our new React application. It is the notebook on the cloud, that is it can be used to store any notes or important points on the cloud. This time we will be storing the data on the server. We will be creating a login Page to grant access to the notes for its right user only. Hence, we have successfully created the iNotebook React app.







// Creating backend for iNotebook:
// We would be putting all the files related to the backend, in a separate backend folder to have a better understanding and segregation. Open the backend folder with the source code editor. After that, open the terminal and execute the 'npm init' command and then fill up some basic details like name, description, entry point, etc to create a package. Now, we can install the required framework inside the package.






// Installing Express and Mongoose
// Express: Express.js is a back-end web application framework for "Node.js". To install express, simply execute the below command in the terminal:
// npm i express 


// Mongoose: Mongoose is an extraction layer on top of MongoDB, which would help us to connect with the Node Js. It requires a connection to a MongoDB database. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model the application data. To install Mongoose, execute the below command in the terminal:
// npm i mongoose


// Note: We would install many more packages later on this React Course. Make sure to create an "Index.js" file, which would be the entry point of our application.




// ThunderClient
// It helps in testing the APIs. For example, Below we have sent a request in the https://www.thunderclient.io/welcome API and have got a response from the API. Now, we can use this response in the application. To use it, We can simply install the thunderclient extension in vscode.
